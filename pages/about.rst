Greetings!

Welcome to `www.railab.me <https://www.railab.me>`_ - a site where I share my
passion for mechatronics engineering, with a specific focus on embedded systems
and electronics.

I'm Mateusz, better known on the Internet as `raiden00 </pages/contact>`_.

I love freedom, engineering, and an active lifestyle. I don't appreciate
statism, shitty engineering, and intellectual property nonsense.

This place serves as a space to share my ideas, follow my work, and recount my
experiences. The source code of the website can be found
`here <https://github.com/railab/railab_blog>`_.

I'm a big advocate of decentralization and localism; thus, you'll find topics
here about open source, desktop manufacturing, automation, and DIY.

For as long as I can remember, I've been passionate about various forms of
engineering. I've delved into chemistry and pyrotechnics, explored the world of
high voltages and high energies, constructed CNC machines, and engaged in
gardening and plant breeding (with a focus on carnivorous plants and chili peppers).

My current interest lies mainly in embedded systems. However, through this blog,
I aspire to revisit and explore other exciting engineering fields and ideas.
Let's see what happens :)

On a daily basis, I work with `Apache NuttX <https://nuttx.apache.org/>`_ RTOS
as an independent contractor and just for fun. Therefore, you can expect
content related to this topic.
